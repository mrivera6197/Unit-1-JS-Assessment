## Hints

#### Helpful tips & reminders ðŸ”Ž

* **Critical:** Don't make assumptions about input data types. (Convert/handle `Numbers` & `null`)
    * Convert **number strings** into **actual numbers** with built-in functions `parseInt`, `parseFloat`, `Number`, etc.
* Ensure your functions **`return somethingUseful`.**
* Make sure you understand the requirements. All the words used? Try list the steps in comments first.
* Don't forget the source data uses `snake_case` naming.
* Pay close attention to array vs. object syntax (`vehicles[0].name` vs. `character.vehicles`.)
* Some of the functions include detailed instructions.
* You might have to infer the desired fields. Carefully read the description and function name (description included above the function.)
